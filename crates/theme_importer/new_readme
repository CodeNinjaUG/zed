# Importing VSCode Theme to Zed Editor

## Open Terminal
Open up your terminal.

## Navigate to VSCode Extensions
Type the following command to navigate to the VSCode extensions directory:
```bash
cd ~/.vscode/extensions
```

## Locate Theme
Look for the theme name that was listed in your VSCode editor, let's say it's called "liviuschera.noctis-10.43.1".

## Navigate to Theme Directory
Type the following command to navigate to the theme directory:
```bash
cd liviuschera.noctis-10.43.1
```

## Access Themes
Then, navigate to the themes directory within "liviuschera.noctis-10.43.1":
```bash
cd themes
```

## Choose Theme
It will then present a list of .json files. Choose the theme you want to open by typing:
```bash
open . name.json
```
It will by default open the JSON in your default compiler, and you will copy all the JSON.

## Create New Terminal
Open a new terminal.

## Navigate to Zed Themes
Type the following command to navigate to the Zed themes directory:
```bash
cd ~/.config/zed/themes
```

## Create New Theme File
Create a new name.json by typing:
```bash
touch themename.json
```

## Copy JSON
Copy the JSON from the previous default compiler.

## Edit JSON File
Type the following command to edit the new theme JSON file using nano:
```bash
nano themename.json
```

## Paste JSON
Paste all the JSON into the file.

## Save File
Save the file by pressing CONTROL + O and then CONTROL + X to exit nano.

## Restart Zed
Restart Zed editor. Under the menu, look for the select themes section, type the name of the added theme, and select it.

## Finished
That's it! You have successfully imported a VSCode theme to the Zed editor.
